# WordPress Playground web instance

[https://playground.wordpress.net/](https://playground.wordpress.net/) is a versatile web tool that allows developers to run WordPress in a browser without needing a server. This environment is particularly useful for testing plugins, themes, and other WordPress features quickly and efficiently.

Some key features:

-   **Browser-based**: No need for a local server setup.
-   **Instant Setup**: Run WordPress with a single click.
-   **Testing Environment**: Ideal for testing plugins and themes.

Via [Query Params](/developers/apis/query-api/) we can directly load in the Playground instance things such as a specific version of WordPress, a theme, a plugin or a more complex setup via blueprints (check [here](/quick-start-guide#try-a-block-a-theme-or-a-plugin) some examples).

From the Playground website there are also available some toolbars to customize your playground instance and to provide quick access to some resources and utilities.
